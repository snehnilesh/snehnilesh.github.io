  <h1>Privacy Policy – Apps by Sneh Nilesh</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 25 October 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to mobile and web applications published by <strong>Sneh Nilesh</strong>. It explains what information may be processed when you use our apps and how third‑party providers we rely on handle data. App‑specific notices may supplement this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not directly collect personal or sensitive personal information within our apps unless you choose to provide it (for example, if you contact support). However, our apps may interact with third‑party services to provide core functionality (for example, AI generation). These providers may collect limited information such as device identifiers, usage metadata, IP address, or cookies as described in their respective policies.</p>

  <h2>2. Cookies & Similar Technologies</h2>
  <p>Our websites and in‑app web views may use cookies and similar technologies operated by <strong>third‑party providers</strong> (for example, analytics, crash reporting, content delivery, or AI service providers) to improve performance and user experience. You can control cookies via your device or browser settings; disabling cookies may affect functionality.</p>

  <h2>3. Third‑Party Services & Data Handling</h2>
  <p>To deliver features, some apps connect to external AI services. Data sent to these services is handled under their own privacy terms. Key services include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Hugging Face API (used by FluxGen):</strong><br />
      <em>FluxGen</em> uses the Hugging Face API to power AI photo generation. Hugging Face may process non‑personal or personal information related to API usage. For details, see the <a href="https://huggingface.co/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugging Face Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong><br />
      Some apps may use Google’s Gemini models via the Gemini API / Google AI for Developers. Google explains its handling of Gemini data in its product documentation and privacy materials. See the <a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini Apps Privacy Hub (Google)</a> and the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini API Additional Terms</a> for more information.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. Please review their policies to understand what data they collect, how they use it, and any choices available to you.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>We generally do not operate our own servers for content you submit within AI features. Data transmitted for AI processing (e.g., prompts, images) is sent to the relevant third‑party provider (e.g., Hugging Face for FluxGen, or Google for Gemini) and may be processed and retained by them in accordance with their policies. We do not keep such data on our own servers unless expressly stated in an app‑specific notice.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights & Controls</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict use of your personal information. Because we do not generally collect personal data directly, requests related to information processed by third‑party providers should be directed to those providers via the links above. For questions about our apps, please contact us using the details below.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our apps are not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice within the app or on the relevant website. Continued use after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or data handling in our apps, contact:<br />
